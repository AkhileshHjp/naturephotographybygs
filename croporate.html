								<p>Businesses organise events for many reasons, they may want to educate, reward, motivate, celebrate, mark key milestones, manage organisational change or encourage collaboration. Whatever the reason may be, there is an event solution.

								A recent report shows that there is a growth of Event Management Industry by 20-30% in India. As you may imagine with such a large amount of events they will take many forms. Below is a short description of the most popular formats for corporate events:

								Conferences

								Conferences usually last for a minimum of one day and are used by businesses to provide information to a specific audience. Often used as a tool to educate and motivate attendees, they are also an opportunity to increase collaboration and engage the audience.

								Conferences will often have several key note speakers and multiple breakout areas, where more in depth sessions on specific topics take place. Conferences are a popular format for corporate events as they can be adapted to suit various stake holders including employees, customers, resellers etc. They also provide an opportunity for the targeted audience to be absorbed into the brand.

								<p>Company milestone events
								Similar to appreciation events, company milestone events are a cause for celebration. Depending on the company’s size and public presence, the execution may vary. These events may be limited to company employees or may include key clients and figures. Some kind of media coverage and public presence may also help spread the word about the business’ success.
								Trade shows
								Think of trade shows as an opportunity for companies to showcase their products and services to a huge audience. Several members of a particular industry come together to discuss and engage in some healthy competition over the course of a few days. Local trade shows may be held at a local arena or hotel, allowing businesses to connect with multiple prospects at once.

								Trade shows usually consist of workshops and presentations, as well as plenty of evening networking events. The media and popular influencers are also involved. Exhibitors pay to have their booth set up while attendees pay a small entrance/attendance fee.

								<p>Seminars and conferences
									Seminars and conferences make up the majority of all corporate events. Their primary purpose is to provide guests with new and relevant information about the industry and company in question.

									Seminars are often shorter, standalone events that don’t last more than a few hours. Participants gather in the same space, and the number of speakers is usually limited as well. 

									Conferences are big events that comprise multiple sessions. They can go on for days, which is one of the main reasons why they’re usually held at hotels. It’s not uncommon to have several sessions taking place at the same time.
																		Golf events
									There’s a reason why so many people consider golf the sport of business. Great for making connections and building relationships, golf events are a favourite among many organisations.

									The relaxed environment and laid-back atmosphere allow guests to form strong bonds and seal deals that would otherwise seem impossible. That being said, corporate golf events can be quite a challenge to plan and execute properly. High green fees can exhaust your budget, and challenging courses can exhaust your guests; choose wisely!
