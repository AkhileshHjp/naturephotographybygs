								<p>Family photography is all about capturing groups of people that have family ties. These range from the 		small group, such as parents and their children.
									Newborn photography also falls under this umbrella. Families often want to show off their newest members.
									Of course, if family photography were as simple as picking up a camera and shouting ‘say cheese!’, we’d all be doing it. But it’s not; there are a ton of little intricacies to it.
									Often, the members of the family or group are inexperienced models in front of the camera. You need to make them feel comfortable and at ease.
									Natural images are the best, but they shouldn’t all be candid. You, the photographer, have the control. But the family supplies the mood, tone and the action.

							<div id="ph_2a"><p>Plan ahead
									It’s always good to plan ahead, especially when you’ve got kids involved. The first thing to plan is, of course, the timing. Avoid having photo sessions at nap time. Choose the time when they’re still fresh, and preferably after mealtime (a safe option, not only for kids but also for adults!). Keep the session short to avoid boredom, or if you have a large group, prioritize kid’s shots first.

									When it comes to the location, you can’t always choose where the family gathering takes place. In this case, your best bet is to scout good spots in that location (think of well-lit spots, uncluttered background, and preferably a wide space). At the same time, make sure you lay out the different kinds of photos that you want to take, from candid to posed shots.

								<p>This sounds obvious but I’m as guilty as the next person of not checking that something fits until the day I need to wear it. And then finding it’s perhaps a little tighter than I would like… Clothes that are too tight or too loose tend to be less flattering. Heavier fabrics tend to hang better, very light t-shirts for example can cling whereas classic cuts will always look good.

								Very tight t-shirts, which often look great if you’re standing up, photograph less well if you’re sitting and snuggling with your child. And down jackets do add a couple of inches, so a tailored jacket or coat looks better. Also, it’s worth clearing your pockets as that will affect the way your clothes hang. If you can, put wallets and phones in a small bag (or I can carry them for you) which will look better in your pictures.
								According to the famous maxim, there’s no such thing as bad weather just inappropriate clothing. This is true for photo shoots too. Dress for the weather we have not the weather you want. If it’s cold, then we need jumpers, coats and hats. If it’s wet underfoot, then wellies are the way to go.

									A warm happy child will be much better to photograph than a cold child even if they’re wearing the beautiful jumper granny knitted. Thermals can
