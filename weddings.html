								<p>A wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. Wedding traditions and customs vary greatly between cultures, ethnic groups, religions, countries, and social classes. Most wedding ceremonies involve an exchange of marriage vows by a couple, presentation of a gift (offering, rings, symbolic item, flowers, money, dress), and a public proclamation of marriage by an authority figure or celebrant. Special wedding garments are often worn, and the ceremony is sometimes followed by a wedding reception. Music, poetry, prayers, or readings from religious texts or literature are also commonly incorporated into the ceremony, as well as superstitious customs.
									The wedding ceremony is often followed by wedding reception or a wedding breakfast, in which the rituals may include speeches from the groom, best man, father of the bride and possibly the bride,[9] the newlyweds' first dance as a couple, and the cutting of an elegant wedding cake. In recent years traditions have changed to include a father-daughter dance for the bride and her father, and sometimes also a mother-son dance for the groom and his mother.

							<div id="ph_2a"><p>The use of a wedding ring has long been part of religious weddings in Europe and America, but the origin of the tradition is unclear. One possibility is the Roman belief in the Vena amoris, which was believed to be a blood vessel that ran from the fourth finger (ring finger) directly to the heart. Thus, when a couple wore rings on this finger, their hearts were connected. Historian Vicki Howard points out that the belief in the "ancient" quality of the practice is most likely a modern invention.[2] In the United States of America, a groom's wedding band has not appeared until the early 20th century,[3] while in Europe it has been part of the tradition sine the ancient Romans, as witnessed by the jurist Gaius.

							The exit from the wedding ceremony is also called the "send off", and often includes traditional practices, such as the newlyweds and the wedding party bowing and kissing the knees of the elders in Ethiopian weddings. The send off often includes throwing rice (a symbol of prosperity and fertility)[4] or other seeds at the newlyweds in most of the Western world,[5] as well as for example India[4] and Malaysia.[6] Despite fears of the opposite, the use of uncooked rice for this purpose is not harmful to birds.[7] Shoe tossing in place of rice has also been used in several cultures.[8]

								<p>Family photography is all about capturing groups of people that have family ties. These range from the 		small group, such as parents and their children.
									Newborn photography also falls under this umbrella. Families often want to show off their newest members.
									Of course, if family photography were as simple as picking up a camera and shouting ‘say cheese!’, we’d all be doing it. But it’s not; there are a ton of little intricacies to it.
									Often, the members of the family or group are inexperienced models in front of the camera. You need to make them feel comfortable and at ease.
									Natural images are the best, but they shouldn’t all be candid. You, the photographer, have the control. But the family supplies the mood, tone and the action.
